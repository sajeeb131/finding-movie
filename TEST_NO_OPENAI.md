# Testing Without OpenAI API Key

## Current Status

✅ **OpenAI API**: Not configured (expected)
✅ **Simple Analyzer**: Working as fallback
✅ **TMDB Search**: Fixed to use correct endpoint

## Test the System

Since you don't have an OpenAI API key, the system will use the simple analyzer. Let's test if the TMDB fix is working:

### Test 1: Simple Analyzer
```bash
node -e "const { analyzePromptSimple } = require('./services/simple-analyzer'); console.log(analyzePromptSimple('Find the titanic movie'));"
```

**Expected**:
```json
{
  "movieName": "titanic",
  "actors": [],
  "genre": ["romance", "drama"],
  "year": null,
  "keywords": ["ship", "romantic"],
  "mood": "romantic"
}
```

### Test 2: Full Movie Search
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/ai/test-prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Find the titanic movie"}'
```

**What to Look For**:
1. ✅ `aiAnalysis.movieName` should be "titanic"
2. ✅ `aiAnalysis.genre` should include "romance" and "drama"
3. ✅ `tmdbResults` should contain the 1997 Titanic movie
4. ✅ `tmdbResults[0].title` should be "Titanic" (1997)

### Test 3: Check Server Logs
Run the test above and check the server console for:
```
AI extracted parameters: {...}
Searching TMDB with movie name: titanic
TMDB API Call: /search/movie with params: { query: 'titanic' }
TMDB returned X results
Top 3 results:
1. Titanic (1997) - Popularity: [number]
2. [Other movies]
```

## If It's Still Not Working

### Check 1: Simple Analyzer Output
If the simple analyzer doesn't extract "titanic" correctly, there might be an issue with the pattern matching.

### Check 2: TMDB API Key
Make sure your TMDB API key is working:
```bash
grep TMDB_API_KEY .env
```

### Check 3: Server Restart
Restart the server to ensure all changes are loaded:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

## Expected Behavior

Without OpenAI, the system should:
1. ✅ Use simple analyzer to extract "titanic"
2. ✅ Call TMDB `/search/movie` endpoint
3. ✅ Return 1997 Titanic as top result
4. ✅ Include trailer and cast information

## Debug Information

The system will now log:
- What parameters were extracted
- Which TMDB endpoint was called
- How many results were returned
- The top 3 results with titles and years

This will help us identify exactly where any issues might be occurring.

## Next Steps

1. Run Test 1 to verify simple analyzer
2. Run Test 2 to check full search
3. Look at server logs for debugging info
4. Verify the 1997 Titanic appears as top result

The system is designed to work completely without OpenAI, so you should get good results with just the simple analyzer and TMDB!
